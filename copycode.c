Open the file using the fopen function, which returns a FILE pointer. For example:

c
Copy code
FILE* file = fopen("filename.txt", "r");
Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of articles:

c
Copy code
int articleCount = 0;
Read the contents of the file line by line using the fgets function until the end of the file is reached:

c
Copy code
char line[100];  // Adjust the buffer size according to your needs

while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), file)) {
    // Process each line
}
Inside the loop, check if the line contains the starting delimiter ("<article>") and the ending delimiter ("</article>") using the strstr function:

c
Copy code
if (strstr(line, "<article>") && strstr(line, "</article>")) {
    articleCount++;
}
After processing the file, close it using the fclose function:

c
Copy code
fclose(file);
Finally, you can print the total count of articles:

c
Copy code
printf("Total articles: %d\n", articleCount);
Remember to handle any error conditions that may occur while opening or reading the file. Additionally, this approach assumes that the articles are properly formatted and do not span multiple lines. You may need to modify the code based on the specific requirements of your file format.
